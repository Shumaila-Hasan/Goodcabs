#  Recommendations:

Focus on improving service quality and offering personalized pricing plans for cities with lower repeat rates.

Tailor marketing efforts to highlight tourism-related campaigns in high-demand periods and offer flexible services for business travelers e.g., loyalty program, ride packages for conferences.

Gradually integrate electric or hybrid vehicles in tier-2 cities to stay competitive and consider offering discounts on eco-friendly rides.

Collaborate with local businesses to offer joint promotions for e.g., free rides for shopping above a certain spend.

Establish partnerships with event venues for exclusive discounts or bundled deals.

Invest in a feedback system to collect qualitative data on passenger satisfaction and driver performance. Use predictive analytics to optimize supply-demand matching.
